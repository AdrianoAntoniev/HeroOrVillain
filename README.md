# HeroOrVillain

App made with Swift and Machine Learning. Based on samples of anime's heroes and villains (e.g Kenshin as hero and Saito as villain), the app identifies when an character is a
villain or a hero. The app analyzes the face, eyes and face shape of the character and gives the result based on it.

This app was made based on Angela Yu's course IOS development.
